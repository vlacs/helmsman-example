# helmsman-example

This application is an example of how Helmsman can be used to drive your web
application(s). It's not immediately obvious how Helmsman should be used just by
looking at the repo and the code so this should shed some light on the matter.


## Leiningen dependancy string
```clojure
[helmsman-example "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]
```

## How to start it up
Spin up a REPL and run ```(user/reset)```. It will start up a web server on port 8080.
